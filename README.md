PassShelter
===========

ATTENTION
=========

This is just a project i made for learning experience. This is **NOT** by **ANY** means, **secure**!


What is it?
-----------

This is a super **simple** password manager I made.
It was originally made in **Python 2.7.8** but it has been ported to **Python 3.4**.

Why?
----

I didn't like any other password manager available for Linux.
I am talking about KeepPassX, Pass, et cetera.  
They are quite good, but they were kinda overkill for me. So I decided to create one myself.  
I did take this as a challenge for myself, mainly, but it was fun!

How to use
----------

Read the `HOWTO.txt` inside `doc/` directory.
